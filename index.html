            I started George Westinghouse High School in September 2014. My strength starting high school was a little different than others because it was only 3 years since I moved away from my home country Guyana. School was very different over there but math was very similar so that was my strong suit. I was very enthusiastic and very willing to learn so I picked on subjects I never encountered before. My weakness in high school was being distracted easily and living environment. Science has always been my weakness, over time i tried to forcibly tried to grasp the basic but I couldnâ€™t. I was very lost in highschool because i never knew what I wanted to actually study or do in life.

        When 11th grade approach my multimedia teacher introduced us to 3 software developers who introduced my class to coding where they then taught us the basics and fundamental. After the class year was coming to an end I was offered a paid internship to learn more coding. I spent my summer learning how to become a freelance web developer. My summer finished and I learned a lot and was satisfied to be part of a great bootcamp. Graduation year approached and I finally figured out what I wanted to do in life and my plans was to learn more coding and find out which job category fits me.
